# HYP

This repository contains a series of "HYpercore Proposal" (HYP)
documents, part of the hypercore protocol development and standardization process.

Proposal documents may be found in the "proposals" folder.

## The Process

TL;DR: write up an HYP markdown file; submit a github PR; revise per review;
community will either accept (merges PR) or not (closes PR). See the ["HYP
Process"][hyp-0001] meta-HYP for details.

For now this process is as simple and informal; as the number of hypercore developers
and users grows, it may become more formal. Precedents and inspiration include:

- [Bittorrent Enhancement Proposals (BEP)](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0001.html)
- [Rust RFC Process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs)
- [Python Enhancement Proposal](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/)

## WG members

The current HYP Working Group members are:

 - Mathias Buus

More WG members may be added at the WG's discretion.
